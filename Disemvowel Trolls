#Disemvowel Trolls
"""Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments,
neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel."""
import re
def disemvowel1(string):
    return re.sub(r'[aeiouAEIOU]', "", string)

def disemvowel2(string):
    vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"]
    return "".join([i for i in string if i.lower() not in vowels])


print(disemvowel1("This website is for losers LOL!"), "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!")
print(disemvowel2("This website is for losers LOL!"), "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!")
